description: Helm's licensing strategy and future plans.
---

Helm is currently distributed under a **source-available, non-commercial license**.

This page outlines the current licensing model and our plans for the future.

## Current License (Pre-1.0)

Helm is free to use for personal, non-commercial purposes.

- **Source Code**: Publicly visible for transparency and evaluation.
- **Personal Use**: Permitted for individual users.
- **Commercial Use**: Not permitted at this time.
- **Redistribution**: Unmodified binaries may be redistributed for non-commercial use.
- **Modification**: Modification and reuse of source code is not permitted.

See the [LICENSE](https://github.com/jasoncavinder/Helm/blob/main/LICENSE) file for the full legal text.

## Future Strategy (Post-1.0)

We intend to transition to a sustainable commercial model at or after version 1.0. The goal is to support ongoing development while maintaining transparency.

### Planned Editions

We are designing Helm to support multiple editions:

- **Free Edition**: Core functionality for individual users.
- **Pro Edition**: Advanced features for power users.
- **Business Edition**: Policy enforcement, compliance, and management features for organizations.

### Why not Open Source?

Helm is currently source-available to protect the project during its early development phase. We may explore open-source models (like Open Core) in the future, but our priority is building a sustainable, high-quality product.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! To ensure we can evolve the licensing model in the future, all contributors must sign a [Contributor License Agreement 
(CLA)](https://github.com/jasoncavinder/Helm/blob/main/docs/legal/CLA.md).

This agreement grants the project the necessary rights to relicense contributions as part of commercial or open-source releases.
