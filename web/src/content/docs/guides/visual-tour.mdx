Helm has two main surfaces: a **menu bar popover** for quick triage and a **Control Center window** for deeper management. This tour walks through each.

<Aside type="note">
Screenshots show Helm `v0.16.0` UI surfaces on macOS. Minor styling may change between builds, and screenshot refreshes are applied as new app captures are published.

## Menu Bar Popover

Click the Helm icon in the menu bar to open the popover. It shows your environment health at a glance: update counts, active tasks, and quick actions.

<ThemeImage

  light={menuBarPopoverLight}
  dark={menuBarPopoverDark}
  alt="Menu bar popover showing health status, pending updates, and quick actions."
/>

---

## Status Menu

Right-click the Helm icon for quick actions: About, Control Center, Upgrade All, Settings, Support Helm, Refresh, and Quit.

<ThemeImage

  dark={statusMenuShotDark}
  alt="Right-click status menu with quick actions."
/>

## Control Center — Overview

The Control Center is a standalone window with sidebar navigation. The **Overview** tab shows health posture, package statistics, the manager grid, and recent task activity.

<ThemeImage
  class="tour-shot"
  light={controlCenterOverviewShot}
  dark={controlCenterOverviewShotDark}
  alt="Control Center overview with health posture and manager grid."
/>

---

## Control Center — Packages

Browse installed, upgradable, and available packages. Filter by status or manager. Click any package to see details in the inspector sidebar.

<ThemeImage
  class="tour-shot"
  light={controlCenterPackagesShot}
  dark={controlCenterPackagesShotDark}
  alt="Packages tab with package list and filters."
/>

---

## Control Center — Tasks

Track all background operations in real time. Tasks show lifecycle states: Queued, Running, Completed, Failed, or Canceled.

<ThemeImage
  class="tour-shot"
  light={controlCenterTasksShot}
  dark={controlCenterTasksShotDark}
  alt="Tasks tab showing task list with status indicators."
/>

---

## Control Center — Managers

View per-manager health, detection status, and capabilities. Managers show health badges (Healthy, Attention, Error, Not Installed).

<ThemeImage
  class="tour-shot"
  light={controlCenterManagersShot}
  dark={controlCenterManagersShotDark}
  alt="Managers tab showing health badges across package managers."
/>

---

## Control Center — Settings

Configure cadence, policy, localization, and accessibility. The **Support & Feedback** card provides direct links to report bugs, request features, and share diagnostics.

<ThemeImage
  class="tour-shot"
  light={controlCenterSettingsShot}
  dark={controlCenterSettingsShotDark}
  alt="Settings tab with General, Managers, Advanced, and Support and Feedback cards."
/>

---

## Inspector Sidebar

Select any task, package, or manager in the Control Center to open the inspector sidebar. It shows contextual detail: version info, pin state, manager attribution, health badges, and available actions.

<ThemeImage
  class="tour-shot"
  light={inspectorSidebarShot}
  dark={inspectorSidebarShotDark}
  alt="Inspector sidebar showing package or manager detail."
/>

## Onboarding Walkthrough

On first launch, Helm offers a guided walkthrough using spotlight overlays that highlight key UI elements with step-by-step explanations. You can replay it anytime from Settings.

<ThemeImage
  class="tour-shot"
  light={onboardingSpotlightShot}
  dark={onboardingSpotlightShotDark}
  alt="Walkthrough spotlight overlay highlighting a UI element."
