import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Helm has two main surfaces: a **menu bar popover** for quick triage and a **Control Center window** for deeper management. This tour walks through each.

<Aside type="note">
Screenshots show Helm v0.13.0-rc.2 on macOS. The interface may vary slightly between versions.

The popover adapts to dark mode automatically.
