## Why Helm?

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Unified Control Plane" icon="laptop">
		Manage Homebrew, mise, rustup, softwareupdate, mas, and more from one native macOS menu bar app. No more switching between terminals.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Safety First" icon="approve-check-circle">
		Structured process execution, authority-ordered refresh, and no shell injection risks. Your system stays predictable.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Smart Orchestration" icon="rocket">
		Toolchain managers refresh before package managers. Parallel execution across managers, serial within each. Failures are isolated.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Native & Fast" icon="apple">
		Built with Rust and SwiftUI. Instant search, low memory usage, and real-time task tracking from your menu bar.
	</Card>
</CardGrid>

## Current Status

Helm is in active pre-1.0 development at **v0.13.0-beta.2**. Fifteen managers are functional with authority-ordered refresh, progressive search, pin/safe-mode policy controls, broad localization coverage, and a redesigned menu bar/control-center shell. See the [roadmap](/product-roadmap/) for what's next.

> **Beta Testing Program:** `v0.13.0-beta.2` is open for external testing. Please file feedback and bug reports via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/jasoncavinder/Helm/issues/new/choose).

Helm is currently source-available under a non-commercial license. See the [licensing page](/licensing/) for details.
