Helm `v0.17.2` is now released on `main`.

This stable patch follows `v0.17.0` and `v0.17.1` and focuses on operator-facing reliability and control improvements across manager execution selection, onboarding detection flow, and diagnostics usability.

## Highlights

- Manager executable-path and install-method selections are now actionable and enforced in runtime command routing.
- Onboarding now runs detection-only first-pass behavior with clearer version-loading state handling.
- Failed-task diagnostics now support selectable text and `Copy All` actions across diagnostics, stdout, stderr, and logs.
- Disabled manager behavior is now consistently enforced across refresh/search/task flows.
- Dark-mode list-surface styling is aligned in both Tasks and Packages views.
