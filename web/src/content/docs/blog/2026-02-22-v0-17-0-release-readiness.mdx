Helm `v0.17.0` is moving from release-candidate hardening toward the stable cut.

## What landed during the RC cycle

- Self-update reliability fixes for Sparkle prerelease semantics and installer launch behavior.
- Expanded diagnostics coverage across task lifecycle logging, manager detection details, and support export workflows.
- Inspector and task-surface quality improvements for command/output visibility and troubleshooting flow.
- Privileged-action authentication support using managed `sudo -A` handling for elevated manager operations.
- Responsiveness work in Control Center and popover surfaces, including adaptive polling and lazy list rendering.

## Stable-release gate

Before the stable `v0.17.0` release, we are validating:

- Core Rust and macOS test suites.
- Localization integrity and length safety.
- Updater feed behavior and direct-channel update checks.
- Release-process artifacts and website/changelog synchronization.

If you are testing `v0.17.0-rc.5`, please file any reproducible issue details in GitHub with environment, expected behavior, and observed behavior.
