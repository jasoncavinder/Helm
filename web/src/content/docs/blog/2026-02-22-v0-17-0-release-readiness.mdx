Helm `v0.17.x` has completed release-candidate hardening and shipped stable. The latest release on `main` is `v0.17.2`.

## What shipped in 0.17.x

- Stable diagnostics/logging delivery: task log viewing, structured support export, service health visibility, and manager detection diagnostics.
- Onboarding and detection hardening: detection-only first-run flow, immediate presence signals, and version-loading states while probes finish.
- Manager execution-control improvements: explicit executable-path and install-method selection with persistence and runtime command routing.
- Manager enablement enforcement: disabled managers are now excluded from task/search/refresh flows and their in-flight tasks are canceled.
- Control Center and inspector polish: execution-plan presentation scoping, diagnostics usability improvements, and dark-mode list-surface fixes.

## Release status

- `v0.17.0`: stable cut from the full RC lineage (`rc.1` through `rc.5`).
- `v0.17.1`: stable patch correcting artifact-release lineage after the failed `v0.17.0` build attempt.
- `v0.17.2`: current stable patch with manager-selection execution routing, onboarding fixes, diagnostics UX improvements, and release-flow guardrail follow-up.

## What’s next

Current planning focus is `0.18.x` local security groundwork while monitoring post-release feedback from `v0.17.2`.
