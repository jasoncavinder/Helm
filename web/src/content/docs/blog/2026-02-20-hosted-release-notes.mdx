Helm update release notes are now hosted directly on `helmapp.dev` instead of linking out to GitHub release pages.

## What changed

- Release automation generates per-tag release-note HTML from `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Generated notes are published under `updates/release-notes/<tag>.html`.
- Sparkle `releaseNotesLink` entries now point to these hosted pages.

## Why this helps

- More consistent presentation in updater windows.
- Better control over formatting and release-note continuity.
- Cleaner future path for website-integrated release communication.
