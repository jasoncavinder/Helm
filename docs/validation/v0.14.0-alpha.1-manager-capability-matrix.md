# v0.14.0-alpha.1 Manager Capability Matrix

Generated: 2026-02-19

## Scope

This matrix defines the 0.14 manager metadata baseline used by the Rust registry and SwiftUI manager inventory scaffolding.

Legend:

- `implemented`: full end-to-end adapter support currently shipped
- `optional`: manager is optional and defaults to disabled unless explicitly enabled
- `detection_only`: manager is status/detection-only in current scope

## Notes

- Optional default-disabled policy is currently enforced for `asdf`, `macports`, and `nix_darwin`.
- Detection-only status is sourced from Rust registry authority (`DetectionOnly`) and exported through FFI manager status.
- This matrix is a scaffolding baseline; adapter implementation status will change across `0.14.0-alpha.2` and later slices.
