# v0.16.0-rc.5 Installer/Updater Interruption & Recovery Validation

Date: 2026-02-20  
Branch: `feat/v0.16.0-kickoff`  
Target tag: `v0.16.0-rc.5`

## Objective

Validate that direct-channel DMG release automation and Sparkle feed publishing recover cleanly from expected interruption paths, and that policy safeguards keep updates deterministic.

## Scenario Matrix

1. `R1` Build-and-sign release workflow runs to completion from a fresh tag.
Expected: signed DMGs + generated appcast are uploaded to release assets.

2. `R2` Appcast policy guard rejects invalid feed constructs.
Expected: workflow fails if appcast contains delta payloads or non-HTTPS/non-DMG enclosure URLs.

3. `R3` Appcast publication handles protected `main`.
Expected: workflow publishes directly to `main` when allowed; otherwise opens a fallback PR with feed update.

4. `R4` Workflow rerun on same tag is idempotent.
Expected: DMG/appcast upload uses `--clobber`, appcast publish updates same target path without duplicate/ambiguous state.

5. `R5` Runtime update guard on ineligible install sources.
Expected: Sparkle checks stay blocked for package-manager installs and translocated/DMG-mounted execution paths.

## Results

- `R1`: Pending
- `R2`: Pending
- `R3`: Pending
- `R4`: Pending
- `R5`: Pending

## Evidence

- Workflow run URL(s): Pending
- Release tag URL: Pending
- Appcast feed URL: `https://helmapp.dev/updates/appcast.xml`
- Fallback PR URL (if direct push blocked): Pending

## Notes

- `R5` includes runtime/manual verification and is expected to be completed on a local QA host after artifact download.
