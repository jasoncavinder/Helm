Generated: 2026-02-17 04:27:15 UTC

## Scope

- Audit script: `apps/macos-ui/scripts/check_locale_lengths.sh`
- Base locale: `en`
- Checked locales: `es`, `de`, `fr`, `pt-BR`, `ja`
- Checked files: `common.json`, `app.json`, `service.json`
- Heuristic thresholds:
  - ratio > `1.35`
  - absolute length delta > `24`

## Command

```bash
apps/macos-ui/scripts/check_locale_lengths.sh
```

## Result

- Script exit code: `0`
- Outcome: no high-risk overflow candidates were flagged by the configured heuristic thresholds.

### Output

```text
Locale overflow audit
base=en ratio>1.35 abs_delta>24
No high-risk overflow candidates found by heuristic thresholds.
```

## Notes

- This is a heuristic preflight check and does not replace on-device visual validation.
