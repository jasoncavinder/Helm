# HELM Design System
Tagline: “Take the helm.”

## 1. Brand Philosophy

Helm is the command bridge for your system.
It restores operational clarity across fragmented toolchains.

Helm is:
- Commanding
- Calm
- Technical
- Deterministic
- Professional

Helm is not:
- Playful or gimmicky
- Neon or hacker-themed
- Overly minimal to the point of sterile
- Corporate-bureaucratic

Tone: Quiet authority.

## 3. Color System

### Primary: Helm Blue
Deep, modern, macOS-native blue gradient.

- Helm Blue 900: #1B3A66
- Helm Blue 700: #2A5DA8
- Helm Blue 500: #3C7DD9
- Helm Blue 300: #6CA6E8

Use for:
- Active states
- Primary buttons
- Selected navigation
- Focus rings

---

### Accent: Rope Gold
Used sparingly.

- Gold 500: #C89C3D
- Gold 700: #A97E2A

Use for:
- Pro features
- Priority alerts
- Upgrade elements
- Highlighted badges

Gold must never exceed 10% visual weight on a screen.

- Background: #F5F7FA

## 4. Typography

Primary UI: SF Pro (system default)
Monospace: SF Mono

Website fallback:
- Inter

Rules:
- Large, confident headings
- Generous spacing
- Never cramped layouts

---

## 5. Shape Language

Corner radius: 12–16px
Cards: Soft shadow, subtle elevation
Buttons: Rounded but not pill unless primary CTA

Avoid:
- Sharp hard edges
- Material Design harsh drop shadows
- Glassmorphism excess

---

## 6. Iconography

Inside app:
- SF Symbols
- Clean line icons

Marketing:
- Subtle maritime motifs (compass grid, faint map texture)
- No literal ship wheels everywhere

---

## 7. Motion

Animation should feel:
- Stable
- Smooth
- Purposeful

No bounce effects.
No playful micro-interactions.

Transition timing: 180–240ms ease-out.

---

## 8. Voice

Use:
- Deterministic
- Auditable
- Centralized
- Operational clarity
- System integrity

Avoid:
- “Revolutionary”
- “Game-changing”
- “Next-gen”

Helm speaks like a senior engineer, not a startup pitch deck.
