# 6. Gold Usage Rules

Gold is a signal color, not a theme.

Use Gold only for:
- Pro badges

Never:

- Paragraphs in gold
- Primary UI surfaces in gold

Gold must not exceed 10% visual weight per screen.

---

# 7. Spacing & Rhythm

Helm uses an 8pt grid system.

Spacing guidelines:
- 24px between content blocks
- 32–40px before major headings
- Generous whitespace is required

Tight typography makes Helm feel corporate.
Breathing typography makes Helm feel premium.

Body: #E6EDF6  

Gold should shift slightly brighter in dark mode:
